See the [Solarized homepage](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) for screenshots,
details and color scheme versions for Vim, Mutt, popular terminal emulators and
other applications. These versions can also be found in the main [Solarized repository](https://github.com/altercation/solarized)
on GitHub.

For Quiver this [Quiver-only repository](https://github.com/kyanny/Quiver-Theme-Solarized) is therefore recommended over the main repository.
